### About this project
This is a terminal implementation of the classic board game Battleship.
- Two players have five ships each (2 2x-Destroyer, 1 3x-Cruiser, 1 4x-Battleship and 1 5x-Carrier)
- At the beginning of the game, players take turn to place their ships.
- Then enter into the strike phase; players take turn to choose a location to strike and can keep striking until they miss.
